    <h1>Movie Maniacs</h1>
    <h2>Objective: </h2>
    <p>Movie Maniacs is an app that connects movie lovers to their favorite movies 
        and fellow cinema enthusiasts. This is a project where I build the 
        server-side API of a cinema themed web app. This web application will provide 
        users with info about different movies, directors, and genres. Users will 
        be able to sign up for an account, update their personal information, 
        and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
